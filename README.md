# The Bipolar Cat

> Made for Ludum Dare 32, "An unconditional weapon"

You (a cat :cat:) have been fully trained to bring happiness to human being. The world is in crisis and the only hope is **you**.  
But cats can be very selfish and evil sometimes... what about you? Will you save the world? Let it as is it? Or worse... destroy it?

You are an angel and a devil. You are the **Bipolar Cat**.  
Depending on how you interact with people the world will be directly affected.

Good luck.
